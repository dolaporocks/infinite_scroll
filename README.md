# infinite_scroll
This is a website that works as an infinite scroll of pictures. 

Looking at this project, it seems very simple but all of the work is actually done behind the scenes. 
Working on this project I made use of HTML, CSS< JavaScript and I was able to get those images 
used as an API thrpugh the unsplash website. Working on this was a bit challenging at several 
occassions but i was able to come to understand all that was done and then it all came to play. 
Thanks to my amazing professor at Udemy giving us the chance to create things in our own way and 
learn as we go. 
Another fun thing about this project is that all images are actually links that leads to the official 
unsplash websute so that users are able to easily download the images to their device in whatever 
format they choose. 
This was a fun project and I am glad I embarked on it.
